package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/udawtr/arcclimate-go/arcclimate"
)

func main() {
	data := arcclimate.Interpolate(33.88, 130.8, 2012, 2018, "api", "EA", true, "Perez", ".cache")

	var buf *bytes.Buffer = bytes.NewBuffer([]byte{})
	data.ToCSV(buf)
	fmt.Print(buf.String())

## Difference from Python version

* Run very fast. More than 10x.
* There is no control function for log output.
* For speed, mesh_3d_elevation.csv has been split into mesh_3d_ele_{mesh1d}.csv. (By split_mesh_3d_ele.py)
